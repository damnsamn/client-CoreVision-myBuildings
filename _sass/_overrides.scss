/*

This file should hold only the general styles that you need to override from other packages
or 3rd-party stylesheets (which should be located in /vendor).

The below commented block of code will re-define Bootstrap 4's breakpoints and container max-widths.
Bootstrap 4's breakpointed classes are compiled based on the below SCSS maps within Bootstrap's own
stylesheets. By overriding them here with our own breakpoints and max-widths, we can automatically
add our own breakpoints to Bootstrap's existing classes:
eg .col-[your-breakpoint-name]-12
